# Codecademy Exam Project for Chapter: Building Interactive Websites

## Book Finder Website

### End Result / Goal

This site allows the user to input a genre, title, or author into the search bar, and get back a list of books that match that criteria.

### Set up

-   list of books that will be searched contained in `bookList.js`
-   helper functions already set up in `helper.js`

### Task

The task is to finish building the application by completing the function definitions for the `captureSearchValue()`, `filterBooks()`, `structureBooksAsHtml()`, and `searchBtnClickHandler()` functions. Edits should only be made to these four function definitions within `script.js`.
